## Description

Hello Everyone, this is where I submitted my assignment given by Mr.Cooper. The task was to build a movie review platform with different use cases. To Build a movie review platform that collects reviews for movies from its users and later uses the reviews to derive insights which help in providing better recommendations.
#### Note: I have build an end-to-end application using React JS for building front-end using PrimeReact and Bootstrap frameworks, Node js for hosting and running the web server and used MySQL for fetching data for back-end. I got to learn many new things while building this project.
